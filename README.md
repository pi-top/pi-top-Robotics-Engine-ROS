# pi-top Robotics Engine
Middleware based on ROS for building and programming pi-top Robotics.

pi-top's Robotics Engine runs inside a Ubuntu Docker Container and is currently based on Noetic (ROS 1) - this means 
Python 3 is supported out of the box. The Robotics Engine provides a number of services designed to abstract low-level
control of the hardware, enable modular software design and encourages re-use where possible.
